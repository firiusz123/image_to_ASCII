# image_to_ASCII
basically it is simple script that converts an image to a ASCII art .txt file 
-it replaces every single pixel with ascii sign so higher resolution pictures will be harder to view 
also i include rose sketch that looks great after converting it to ascii (befor convertion looks nice too)
